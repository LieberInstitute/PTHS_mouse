Using 3 different diagnostic measures of autism to evaluate 14 children with SLOS ranging from 3 to 16 years, Sikora et al., 2006 found that three-fourths of the children with SLOS (71-86% depending on the evaluation method) had ASD.

A de novo missense variant in UBE3A (p.Thr485Ala) that was identified in a male ASD proband from the Simons Simplex Collection in PMID 25363768 was demonstrated in PMID 26255772 to abolish a phosphorylation site involved in regulating UBE3A activity.  As a result of this variant, mutant UBE3A showed enhanced UBE3A activity in vitro and enhanced substrate turnover, which in turn caused excessive dendritic spine development in vivo.  Increased UBE3A gene dosage in mice resulted in defective social interaction, impaired communication, and increased repetitive stereotypic behavior in PMID 21974935.","19404257, 19557195, 21624971, 18361419, 12851639, 10089011, 25363768, 26255772, 21974935",Sfari
