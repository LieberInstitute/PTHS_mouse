# Description of data & code


## Github
1) [Sample sheet](tcf4_mouse/tables/stable1_RNAseq_sample_info.xlsx) describing files, genotype, sex, batch, etc between the 2 sets of RNA-seq from the Maher lab and Philpot lab. An aggregated phenotype table of these samples are at [here](tcf4_mouse/tables/maher_philpot_PTHS_mouse_rnaseq_pheno_relativePaths.csv)

2) DEG analyses
- Analyses 

3) Figures: Individual scripts to generate various panels from the main publication are kept in the main github directory:


## [Globus](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=eee07044-9e5c-11ed-b579-33287ee02ec7&origin_path=%2F)

Intermediates and final summary files describing the transcriptomics analyses are deposited on Globus. These are all files that would be found at `/dcl01/lieber/ajaffe/Brady/mouseRNAseq` and subdirectories within the Github Rscripts. To access Globus, a user would have to [make a Globus ID](https://www.globusid.org/create) and [follow instructions](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/) to grab these data.
